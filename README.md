Comments from Jerome Ward:

Sprint 6:
In this Sprint I added features, which enable a person to use the "Esc" key or click on the "overlay", in addition to exit button, to exit from the "preview card", "edit profile" and "add card" modals. I also added HTML, CSS, and javascript code to enable validation of the input fields for the "edit profile" and "add card" forms.

Planned updates:
1. Add feat to reset validation form inputs.
2. Add feat to determine additional acceptable inputs for forms, e.g. a spacebar does not count as an input character when validating number of characters.

First Submission:
1. Add feat to use "Esc" key to exit modals.
2. Add feat to click on overlay to exit modals.
3. Add feat to validate form inputs and show error messages in forms.
4. Used javascript, HTML, CSS code to validate form inputs and show error messages when wrong input is detected.
5. Used javascript, HTML, and CSS code to close modals using "Esc" and clicking on overlay.
6. 
Refactored code to make it more streamlined.
