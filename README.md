First Submission:

1. Continued with the refactoring of the Around the U.S. project.
2. Installed a series of productivity tools, which include: Webpack, HTML Webpack, Clean Webpack, 
   NPM, Babel, MiniCSS Loader, MiniCss Extract, PostCSS.
3. After installing the above tools, the project no longer uses GoLive to launch the project. Instead
   uses "npm run dev" to open the project in a local host server at localhost:8080.
4. Created the following .js files and Classes: Section, Popup, PopupWithForm, PopupWithImage, UserInfo, and Constants.
5. Refactored and moved code to the appropriate files and exported and imported the necessary classes and elements.
6. Modified the file structure and moved most the folders and files to the src folder.
7. Fixed the favicon after the installation of tools and moved it to the images folder.
